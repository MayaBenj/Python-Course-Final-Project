# This is the final project of a python course I took.
# Concepts and skills learned: control flow, structures, object oriented programming, 
#           working with strings and files, exceptions and GUI (tkinter).

# To run GUI.py (recommended) you have to download pillow.
# You can also run EmployeeMain.py for a demonstration of the functions.

# About the project: Employee Attendance Management System
